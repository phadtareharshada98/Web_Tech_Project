            and father Shahaji bhosale. It is said that mother Jijabai prayed to lord Shiva on Shivneri fort for a brave
            son
            and kept her son name as Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj.</mark></p>
    <p style="font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Shivaji Maharaj is one of the great national heroes of Mahadeshwara. He created an independent and sovereign
        state in Maharashtra that was based on justice, the welfare of the people, and tolerance to all faiths. The
        aims, objectives, and Rajnitee of the Maratha Swaraj under Chhatrapati Shivaji provided a new direction to the
        contemporary politics of India. In course of time, his movement assumed, the form of an all-India struggle; a
        struggle that was to change the political map of India.</p>
    <p style="font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Shivaji Maharaj was born at the Shivneri fort near Junnar in Pune district on<b>19th February 1630.</b> Shivaji’s
        mother, Jijabai was the daughter of Lakhuji Jadhavrao of Sindkhed. His father Shahajiraje Bhosale was a
        prominent sardar in the Deccan. At the time of Shivaji Maharaj’s birth, most of the territory in Maharashtra was
        under the possession of the Nizamshah of Ahmednagar and the Adilshah of Bijapur. In the coastal belt of Konkan,
        there were two sea powers, the Portuguese and the Siddi. The British and the Dutch who were engaged in expanding
        their trade also had their factories on the coast. The Mughals, since the period of Emperor Akbar 1 wanted to
        expand their power in the South. The Mughals launched a campaign to conquer the Nizamshahi Kingdom. The Adilshah
        of Bijapur allied with the Mughals in this campaign. Shahahajiraje tried to save the Nizamshahi, but he could
        not withstand the combined might of the Mughals and the Adilshahi. The Nizamshahi kingdom came to an end in A.D.
        1636. Thereafter Shahajiraje became a Sardar of the Adilshah of Bijapur and was posted in Karnataka. The region
        comprising Pune, Supe, Indapur, and Chakan Parganas located between the Bhima and Nira rivers which were vested
        in Shahajiraje as a jagir was continued by the Adilshah. Shahaijiraje was also assigned a jagir of Banglore.
        Veermata Jijabai and Shivajiraje, stayed for a few years with Shahajiraje at Banglore till Shivajiraje was
        twelve years old. Shahajiraje entrusted the administration of the lakshmi jagir to Shivajiraje and Veermata
        Jijabai. Shivajiraje grew up amidst the hills and valleys of the Pune region under the guidance of his mother
        Jijabai.Sivaji Maharaj was trained in guerilla warfare.
